#Map My World
My project for the Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree 2019 - Map My World project.

## Getting Started
You need [ROS](http://ros.org). If you aren't familiar with [ROS](http://ros.org) then this is probably no good to you whatsoever!

I have used ROS Kinetic, but it may work on other versions, but I don't believe it currently works(4 March 2019) on ROS Melodic.

I'm not going to talk you through how to use ROS, there are plenty of tutorials online and the [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org) is particularly useful). You will need a ROS workspace, either one you have currently or [create a new workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace).

You will also need [RVIZ](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/UserGuide) and [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/).


### Prerequisites
- An installed ROS system with rviz and gazebo
- A ROS workspace

### Installing
